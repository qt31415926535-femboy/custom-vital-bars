# Custom Vital Bars
Love the Status Bars but just wish they could be repositioned and/or customised?
You can recreate a sleek and classic style with just the bars. Or get fancy - change the direction the bar fills, modify the border to track related progress such as Hitpoint regeneration, make the bar glow when you're at a critical threshold, or more other little aesthetic adjustments!
